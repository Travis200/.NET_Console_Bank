# Banking Console App

## Overview

This is a **.NET console application** I built while beginning to learn **.NET** from following a tutorial created by Microsoft (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/classes)). This is a banking application which uses a basic form of **event sourcing** as each instance of bank account stores the the transactions for that user and then this is used to calculate the users current balance. in the future this could be improved to query a databse for the transactions instead of storing them in the bank account object itself.
